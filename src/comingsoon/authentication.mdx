# Authentication

In this guide, we'll look at how you can authenticate superagent users. If you are usign Superagent for your application this is probably not important for you as you authenticate your users by yourself. But this allows you to create your own agent dashboard or alternatives to the offical superagent applicatoin {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Sign In

This endpoint returns a user and a authorization token.

```swift {{ title: 'Sign In' }}

  func createAgent() async throws {
    let user = SignIn(email: "username", password: "securepassword")
    
    do {
      let signInResponse = try await superagent.signIn(agent: newAgent)
      print("Agent result: \(agent)")
      print("Hi I am Agent \(agent["name"] ?? "none")")
      } catch {
        print("Error when creating agent: \(error)")
        throw error
      }
  }

```

Please don't commit your Protocol password to GitHub!

## OAuth2 with bearer token

The recommended way to authenticate with the Protocol API is by using OAuth2. When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [Protocol dashboard](#) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.

## Using an SDK

If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the [Protocol dashboard](#) under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
